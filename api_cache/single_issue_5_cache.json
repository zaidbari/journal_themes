A self-designed validated Questionnaire was distributed to doctors working in different hospitals of Pakistan through online Google form. Questions regarding emotional and financial stress in Pakistani doctors dealing with COVID-19 patients were included.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Results: <\/strong>&nbsp;One hundred and twenty doctors responded to the current study. Majority of them 97 (80.6%) reported stress during duty hours. Stress level was high among 78 (65.3%) doctors to the extent they thought of leaving the job because of risk of getting infected. Less salaries and family pressure were the other demotivating factors. Most of the doctors 71 (59.2%)] were younger than 30 years of age. Eighty-five (71%) doctors reported being pressurized by the families to leave the job. Shortage of protective gears was also the challenge. A total of 65 (54.2%) doctors got their gears from their institutes, 27 (22.2%) bought their own gears, 23 (19.4%) worked without gears, and 5 (4.8%) got gears from non-governmental organizations (NGOs).<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong> &nbsp;Majority of the doctors reported stress during duty hours regardless of level or experience in that job; the contributing factors included risk of getting infected, lesser salaries and family pressure. During COVID-19 pandemic, doctors feel that they are not only emotionally exhausted but also tried to cope financial challenges while endangering themselves to save the lives of patients.<\/p>","image":null,"doi":"10.51441\/BioMedica\/5-84","authors_names":"Dr. Syed Riazul Hasan, Dr. Zeeshan Hamid, Dr. Muhammad Danial Yaqub, Dr. Syed Rohail Ahmed, Dr. Muhammad Amin Aftab","created_at":"2021-03-01T12:33:18.000000Z","approved_at":null,"published_at":"2021-03-04T17:51:46.000000Z","first_page":384,"last_page":387,"timeline":{"revised_at":"2020-11-29","approved_at":"2020-12-10","published_at":"2020-12-31","submitted_at":"2020-10-18"},"sequence":11,"authors":[{"title":"Dr.","name":"Syed Riazul Hasan","email":"drriaz222@yahoo.com","affiliation":"Head Department of Medicine, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Karachi-Pakistan.","info":null},{"title":"Dr.","name":"Zeeshan Hamid","email":null,"affiliation":"Resident Medical Officer, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Karachi-Pakistan.","info":null},{"title":"Dr.","name":"Muhammad Danial Yaqub","email":null,"affiliation":"Post-graduate Fellows, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Karachi-Pakistan.","info":null},{"title":"Dr.","name":"Syed Rohail Ahmed","email":null,"affiliation":"Post-graduate Fellows, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Karachi-Pakistan.","info":null},{"title":"Dr.","name":"Muhammad Amin Aftab","email":null,"affiliation":"Post-graduate Fellows, Sindh Government Qatar Hospital, Karachi-Pakistan.","info":null}]},{"id":85,"type":"Original Article","title":"Different Phenotypes Caused by the Unique Mutation in the Same Family with Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy","short_title":null,"abstract":"<p><strong>Background and Objective:<\/strong> &nbsp;Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies represent a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from abnormal mitochondrial function.

It has been established in literature that obesity or increased body mass index (BMI) harms the ability of a woman to conceive.
