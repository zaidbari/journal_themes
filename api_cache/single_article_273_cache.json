It has a complex aetiology and different factors like sugar intake, brushing habits, body mass index, and socio-economic status may play a significant role. Apart from dental pain, caries affects children&rsquo;s over all body functions, body growth, and pose a financial burden on families. The objective of the study was to determine the association between sugar intake and dental decay among local paediatric population.<br \/><strong>Methods: <\/strong>This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Ibn-e-Sina Hospital Multan, Pakistan from July, 2019 to December, 2019. Data were collected on a specifically designed questionnaire. A total of 540 participants of age range between 5 and 12 years were selected for this study after taking consent from their parents. The data were analysed using statistical tests of significance.<br \/><strong>Results: <\/strong>Female children were predominantly affected as compared to males (56.7% vs. 43.3%) caries was seen more frequently in children brushing teeth once than those doing it twice (p = 0.01). Children taking cariogenic food between meals and 2 hours before sleep showed a significant association with caries development (p = 0.02; p = 0.01). Primary teeth were affected more (74.18%) than the secondary teeth (11.92%).<br \/><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong> Irregular brushing habits and frequency and timing of cariogenic food intake are the leading causes of caries in children from local population.<\/p>","tags":"Dental, Caries, Sugar intake, Paediatric.","doi":"10.51441\/BioMedica\/5-273","code":null,"authors_names":" Rabia Zafar,  Amna Urooj,  Sehrish Masood","first_page":110,"last_page":113,"issue":"2","volume":"37","created_at":"2021-06-25T05:07:31.000000Z","approved_at":null,"published_at":"2021-08-05T08:09:15.000000Z","timeline":null,"previous":{"id":275,"title":"Effect of Postoperative Analgesia with the Combination of Dexmedetomidine and Butorphanol after Posterior Spinal Surgery"},"next":{"id":277,"title":"Effect of Hip Fracture on Prognosis of Acute Cerebral Infarction"},"authors":[{"article_id":273,"title":null,"name":"Rabia Zafar","email":"rabiazafar2009dent@gmail.com","affiliation":"Assistant Professor, Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Multan  Medical and Dental College, Multan - Pakistan.","sequence":1,"info":{"corresponding":true}},{"article_id":273,"title":null,"name":"Amna Urooj","email":"aamnahurooj@yahoo.com","affiliation":"Postgraduate trainee, Department of Operative Dentistry, Nishtar  Institute of Dentistry, Multan - Pakistan.","sequence":2,"info":null},{"article_id":273,"title":null,"name":"Sehrish Masood","email":"Hassaanmasood057@gmail.com","affiliation":"Dental Surgeon, Multan - Pakistan.","sequence":3,"info":null}]}},"code":200}
